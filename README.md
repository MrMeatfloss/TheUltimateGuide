# Introduction
Welcome! This website is the ultimate guide for newcomers who have developed an interest in saxophones and are now getting started in playing the best instrument ever produced. Follow this ultimate guide to learn which type of saxophone suits YOU the best.


# Why the Saxophone?
Saxophones require very little extra gear in order to start playing. The only equipment necessary is a reed, and a neckstrape (usually provided alongside other maintenance/cleaning tools). The saxophone is also fairly easy to learn with simple buttons, where the placement of where you put your fingers don't really matter as much unlike an instrument like violin. When you press a button, it will react, and it will change it's sound.

# Introduction
Welcome! This website is the ultimate guide for newcomers who have developed an interest in saxophones and are now getting started in playing the best instrument ever produced. Follow this ultimate guide to learn which type of saxophone suits YOU the best.


# Why the Saxophone?
Saxophones require very little extra gear in order to start playing. The only equipment necessary is a reed, and a neckstrape (usually provided alongside other maintenance/cleaning tools). The saxophone is also fairly easy to learn with simple buttons, where the movement of your fingers don't really matter as much in terms of the sound that the instrument produces. Unlike playing a guitar or drums, it doesn't matter how light or how hard you press down a button, the sound will sound the same, meaning the sound of a saxophone comes from the mouth.

# Types of Saxophones
Although there were originally 14 different types of saxophones, only 5 of them are in widespread use as of today. They are the:

# Equipment
Now that you've decided on what saxophone suits you the best, lets talk about what sort of equipment is required in order to start playing.

-Reeds: When it comes to reeds, it is very important to note that reeds must always be in clean and top condition. Even if the reed has a very tiny part where it's a bit chipped out, you should probably get a new one.

Although a pro can make any setup sound good, beginners should always try and make sure that their reeds are in top condition. Beginners should let the reed guide them as they figure out how to play the saxophone. After you slowly get better and figure out your playstyle, reeds become a lot less reliant and you can then create your own sound.

Now lets talk about reed thickness. Reed thickness is seperated by numbers from ranges 2-5. The lower the number, the thinner the reed, and the opposite goes for the bigger numbers. Usually, new players should always start from 2 or 2.5 because the thinner the reed, the easier it is to make sound on your saxophone. There were many times where I would see students struggling to make sound with their saxophone and that is because their reed is too thick at 3+. Start from 2, and slowly work your way up.

The reason why 2 is not so popular despite being the easiest to play is because the thinner the reed the brighter the tone as it vibrates more often. This means that less air is needed to play on a 2 and advanced players may find it annoying. The higher the number, the thicker the reed, and the harder it is to play, but it also brings a deeper and warmer sound with potentially more emotions brought to the table. With a higher ceiling for players, pros tend to always use thicker reeds.

# Cleaning and Maintainence
Cleaning your saxophone after playing is very important to make sure that your mouth piece stay clean and not contaminated. After playing, take the reed off from the mouth piece and wash the mouth piece with soup and water. Washing the reed can help but be careful to not damage it as it is very fragile, so just use water and rinse it a bit.

After playing, the horn and tube of the saxophone will be wet so it is important to use a cleaning swab to clean the inside of the saxophone. Insert the cleaning swab and pull it through the tube of the saxophone

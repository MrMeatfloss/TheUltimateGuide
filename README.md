# Introduction
Welcome! This website is the ultimate guide for newcomers who have developed an interest in saxophones and are now getting started in playing the best instrument ever produced. Follow this ultimate guide to learn which type of saxophone suits YOU the best.


# Why the Saxophone?
Saxophones require very little extra gear in order to start playing. The only equipment necessary is a reed, and a neckstrape (usually provided alongside other maintenance/cleaning tools). The saxophone is also fairly easy to learn with simple buttons, where the movement of your fingers don't really matter as much in terms of the sound that the instrument produces. Unlike playing a guitar or drums, it doesn't matter how light or how hard you press down a button, the sound will sound the same, meaning the sound of a saxophone comes from the mouth.
